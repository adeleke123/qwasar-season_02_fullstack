## Ruby Quest01
Remember to git add && git commit && git push each exercise!

We will execute your function with our test(s), please DO NOT PROVIDE ANY TEST(S) in your file

For each exercise, you will have to create a folder and in this folder, you will have additional files that contain your work. Folder names are provided at the beginning of each exercise under `submit directory` and specific file names for each exercise are also provided at the beginning of each exercise under `submit file(s)`.

| Ruby Quest01	| My First Script |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Submit directory	| ex00 |
| Submit file	| my_first_script.rb |

## Description
Write your first script and have it print ```Hello World!```.
Create a file ```my_first_script.rb```.
Add a printing function (see tips)

## Example 00 (In Javascript)
```
$>node my_first_script.js
Hello World!
$>
```
## Example 01 (In Python)
```
$>python my_first_script.py
Hello World!
$>
```
## Example 02 (In Ruby)
```
$>ruby my_first_script.rb
Hello World!
$>
```
Tip
+ (In Ruby)
+ It will contain puts ```"Hello World!"```

| Ruby Quest01	| My First Variable Integer |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Submit directory	| ex01 |
| Submit file	| my_first_variable_integer.rb |

## Description
The first part of coding is to create a variable. Let's get started with an integer variable.
What does integer variable mean?
In most languages, you have types. A good example is that a letter is different from a number.
In a computer, everything is numbers (0 and 1) but we, as humans, interact with letters (and words) to make them usable there are conventions. A letter is a number and one of these conversion tables is ASCII. (You should Google man ASCII.)

Enough talking!

Replace/Complete the following code. Create a variable with (if needed) the right type.
(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (ruby)

XX = 34
puts(person_age)
Example 00

Input: 
Output: 34

Return Value: nil
Ruby Quest01	My First Variable Char
Submit directory	ex02
Submit file	my_first_variable_char.rb
Description
Let's continue with a char variable. Same as the previous exercise, but this time create a char variable containing a letter.

Replace/Complete the following code. Create a variable with (if needed) the right type.
(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (ruby)

XX = 'c'
puts(my_letter)
Example 00

Input: 
Output: c

Return Value: nil
Ruby Quest01	My First Variable String
Submit directory	ex03
Submit file	my_first_variable_string.rb
Description
What is a string? Is it a word? How can a computer create a string?
It could be defined by "multiple letters", which is translated to multiple "characters."
Is it an array of characters? :-)

Replace/Complete the following code. Create a variable with (if needed) the right type.
(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (ruby)

XX = "Learning is growing"
puts(my_string)
Example 00

Input: 
Output: Learning is growing

Return Value: nil
Ruby Quest01	My Multiple Variables Multiple Type
Submit directory	ex04
Submit file	my_multiple_variables_multiple_type.rb
Description
Replace/Complete the following code. Create multiple variables with (if needed) the right type.
(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (ruby)

XX = 34;
XX = "Luke";
XX = ',';

puts("Hello #{my_name}#{my_comma} I'm #{my_age} years old.")
Example 00

Input: 
Output: Hello Luke, I'm 34 years old.

Return Value: nil
Ruby Quest01	My First Incrementation
Submit directory	ex05
Submit file	my_first_incrementation.rb
Description
Incrementation and decrementation depending on the language, it's either ++ (--) or += 1 (-= 1).

Replace/Complete the following code.
(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (ruby)

my_index = 0
// replace this comment with an increment
puts(my_index)
// replace this comment with an decrement
// replace this comment with an decrement
puts(my_index)
// replace this comment with an increment
// replace this comment with an increment
// replace this comment with an increment
puts(my_index)
Example 00

Input: 
Output: 1
-1
2

Return Value: nil
Ruby Quest01	My First If Else
Submit directory	ex06
Submit file	my_first_if_else.rb
Description
If statements linked to else statements are part of the fundamentals of coding. The challenge is to design the best condition.

A condition controls which part of your code is executed. if contains what to do if the condition is true, and else contains what to do if the condition is not met.

An example:

let earth_is_flat = false;

if earth_is_flat {
  println!("Science doesn't exist");
} else {
  println!("Phew.");
}
Replace/Complete the following code so that we know whether 10 is less than or greater than 20.
(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (ruby)

nbr = 10

if (XX)
  puts("nbr is greater than 20")
else
  puts("nbr is less than 20")
end
Example 00

Input: 
Output: nbr is less than 20

Return Value: nil
