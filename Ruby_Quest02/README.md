## Ruby Quest02
Remember to git add && git commit && git push each exercise!

We will execute your function with our test(s), please DO NOT PROVIDE ANY TEST(S) in your file

For each exercise, you will have to create a folder and in this folder, you will have additional files that contain your work. Folder names are provided at the beginning of each exercise under `submit directory` and specific file names for each exercise are also provided at the beginning of each exercise under `submit file(s)`.

| Ruby Quest02	| My First If Multiple Conditions |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Submit directory	| ex00 |
| `Submit file` |	`my_first_if_multiple_conditions.rb` |

## Description
if conditions are linked to else statements and writing the correct condition can be quite complicated :D.

Your assignment is to write the correct conditions inside the if statements below in order to render the 2 print statements true!

Replace/Complete the following code.
(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (ruby)

a = 10
b = 9
c = 11
d = 10
y = 9
z = 11

if (XX)
  puts("a is bigger than b AND smaller than c AND equal to d")
end

if (XX)
  puts("z OR y are bigger than a")
end
Example 00

Input: 
Output: a is bigger than b AND smaller than c AND equal to d
z OR y are bigger than a

Return Value: nil
Ruby Quest02	My First Function
Submit directory	ex01
Submit file	my_first_function.rb
Description
The syntax is only a small part of what you need to learn to write quality code.
Software Architecture (Designing Software) is really the core part of each project and being a good engineer.

In order to "organize" your code, functions are the key. Let's dive in to functions!

Replace/Complete the following code.
(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (ruby)

## Following XXXXXX will be a function that will print using puts("my_first_function")
XXXXXX
XXXXXX
XXXXXX

my_first_function()
Example 00

Input: 
Output: my_first_function

Return Value: nil
Ruby Quest02	My First While
Submit directory	ex02
Submit file	my_first_while.rb
Description
Repeating is annoying, which is why we could create a program for it. :)

Implement a while loop to print 100 times "I want to code".
(Don't forget to increment the index ;-))

Replace/Complete the following code.
(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (ruby)

index = 0

while (XX)
  puts("I want to code")
  XX
end
Example 00
```
Input: 
Output: I want to code

Return Value: nil
Ruby Quest02	My First Param Function
Submit directory	ex03
Submit file	my_first_param_function.rb
Description
Functions accept parameters. Let's send an integer to our function and print it!

Implement a while loop to call a function detonation in...X seconds.
Your loop will stop at 0. 10 included, but 0 is not.
(Don't forget to decrement the index ;-))

Replace/Complete the following code.
(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (ruby)
```
// function will puts("detonation in... #{seconds_left} secondes.")

timer = 10

while (XX)
  detonation_in(timer)
  XX
end
```
## Example 00
```
Input: 
Output: detonation in... 10 seconds.
detonation in... 9 seconds.
detonation in... 8 seconds.
detonation in... 7 seconds.
detonation in... 6 seconds.
detonation in... 5 seconds.
detonation in... 4 seconds.
detonation in... 3 seconds.
detonation in... 2 seconds.
detonation in... 1 seconds.
```
Return Value: nil
Ruby Quest02	My First Return Function
Submit directory	ex04
Submit file	my_first_return_function.rb
Description
Functions can also return value(s) and the return value(s) can be used later on.

In this exercise you will implement a function which returns the number 7.

Replace/Complete the following code.
(The XX is what you need to replace)

Function prototype (ruby)

# function my_get_seven() will return 7

puts(my_get_seven())
Example 00

Input: 
Output: 7

Return Value: nil
